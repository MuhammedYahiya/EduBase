# EduBase - Intelligent Learning Tracker

EduBase is a command-line-based intelligent learning tracker designed to help users monitor their learning progress across subjects and topics. Built purely with Python and MySQL, the project focuses on showcasing a deep understanding of:

- Python fundamentals (conditions, loops, functions)
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- SQL 
- Data analysis with Pandas/Numpy 
- CLI interface architecture and modular design

## Key Features
- **Register & login system via CLI**: User authentication to access their learning progress.
- **Add subjects and topics**: Users can manage subjects and topics they are learning.
- **Mark topics as completed**: Track and update the completion status of topics.
- **Store progress in local CSV or text files**: Save user progress and load it when needed.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Database**: MySQL (via mysql-connector-python)
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy (for analytics), tabulate or rich (for CLI display), argparse / InquirerPy (for command handling)

## Project Phases
1. **Phase 1: Basic Python**
   - Register & login system via CLI, add subjects and topics, mark topics as completed, store progress in local files.
2. **Phase 2: OOP & Modular Code**
   - Object-Oriented design with classes and reusable modules.
3. **Phase 3: Data Structures & Algorithms**
   - Implement DSA concepts for better management of topics and progress.
4. **Phase 4: Full MySQL Integration**
   - Use MySQL for persistent storage and advanced queries.
5. **Phase 5: Intermediate to Advanced Python**
   - Implement custom exceptions, decorators, and more advanced Python features.
6. **Phase 6: Analytics with Pandas/Numpy**
   - Analyze learning progress and generate reports.
7. **Phase 7: Role-Based Access**
   - Admin and user roles for managing subjects and progress.
